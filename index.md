Welcome to the site of MentalWhiteNoise. I have a different way of looking at... well, everything. I am a project junky; I probably start ten projects for every one that I finish. My intent with this site is to share some of those projects lucky enough to make it to some semblance of completion... or at least the ones that were fun to play with for a while!

I have posts organized by project, instead of date. I will constantly re-organize those posts, adding and editing content to make them useful. Who for? Me! While I am all for sharing knowledge, one of the main reasons for writing these projects down on this site is to organize the projects I complete for my own future reference... "lessons learned" for myself. I will continue to learn things on active projects, so I will continue to update the "articles".
